# myHunter !

## Description

This project involves using CSFML, which allows creating a window, closing it, displaying some sprites, and more. The aim of the project is to gain knowledge about coding with CSFML. To achieve that, you need to manipulate various data types and use specific functions such as `sfRenderWindow`, `sfRenderWindow_PollEvt`, and many more.

## Installation

To compile the project, make sure you use the following folder structure:

```bash
/*.c && .h          # All the necessary .c and .h files
/Makefile          # Automates and simplifies compilation
/include/my.h      # The my.h file, which contains all the function prototypes you need
```

Compile using the following commands:

```bash
make               # Create the lib with all the .c files
make re            # Recompile all the .c files with the modifications you made
```

## Usage

Run the program using the following command:

```bash
./my_hunter
```

For credits and additional information, use:

```bash
